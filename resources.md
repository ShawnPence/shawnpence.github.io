title: Learning Resources
social-description: A list of books, websites, and other useful information for anyone wishing to learn software development
---

Here are some of the many resources I've used to improve myself and my development skills. I hope you find these as helpful in your career as I have in mine.

*The beginner resources I used when I first began programming are out of print, so the list below has no true beginner resources.*

- [Software Development in General](#software-development-in-general)
- [SQL](#sql)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](#algorithms-and-data-structures)
- [Math](#math)

## Software Development in General

**Code Complete**<br>
*Author: Steve McConnell / ISBN: 978-0-7356-1967-8*<br>
This should be on every developer's required reading list. Good practices of software construction are essential to quality maintainable code. This book provides a great foundation for considering implications of decisions early on in the design process, using comments appropriately, and many other topics from large-scale design to small implementation details.

**Udacity [Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)**<br>
*Instructor: Peter Norvig*<br>
I'd been programming for over a decade when I took this course, so for me, much of its content was as much about learning to write Python in a Pythonic way as it was to design software in general, but it would be good for the latter for anyone not already familiar with software design.

## SQL

I listed the books below in the order I read them - the concepts from these books get progressively more advanced, and the advanced books will make more sense with the knowledge foundation from the first books.

**Inside SQL Server 2008 T-SQL Querying**<br>
*Authors: Itzik Ben-Gan, Lubor Kollar, Dejan Sarka, Steve Kass / ISBN: 978-0-7356-2603-4*<br>
There is a newer edition currently available, but I used the 2008 edition. I've heard that the the new edition of the book should be as good as the one I read.

**Inside SQL Server 2008 T-SQL Programming**<br>
*Authors: Itzik Ben-Gan, Dejan Sarka, Roger Wolter, Greg Low, Ed Katibah, Isaac Kunen / ISBN: 978-0-7356-2602-7*<br>
Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to be in print any longer, but there were still e-book versions for sale the last time I looked. If anyone knows of a more recent book or resource that covers this same material in similar depth, please let me know.

**Microsoft SQL Server 2012 High-Performance T-SQL Using Window Functions**<br>
*Author: Itzik Ben-Gan / ISBN: 978-0-7356-5836-3*

**Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Query Tuning & Optimization**<br>
*Author: Benjamin Nevarez / ISBN 978-0-07-182942-7*

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Some of the materials below are language-specific, others use pseudocode and leave it to the reader to implement in the language of their choice. I've noted the programming language used in each course.

**Khan Academy [Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)** - *JavaScript*<br>

**Udacity [Intro to Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215)** - *Python*<br>
*Instructor: Michael Littman*

**Algorithms 4th Edition** - *Java*<br>
*Authors: Robert Sedgwick, Kevin Wayne / ISBN: 978-0-321-57351-3*<br>
When I began reading this, I was working almost exclusively in C#. The differences between C# and Java are small enough that it was relatively easy for me to make the leap from the book's examples in Java to code I could use in C#.

**[Algorithms Illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)** - *pseudocode*<br>
*Author: Tim Roughgarden*<br>
The three books currently available cover about 3/4 of the Coursera specialization listed below. For me personally, these books instantly made sense; everything "clicked" as I was reading them. *Note: the design and implementation of common data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues aren't covered in these books, but you will need to use stacks and queues for graph searches in book 2.*

**Coursera [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) specialization** - *pseudocode*<br>
*Instructor: Tim Roughgarden*<br>
Combined with the books by the same author, any details that were rough after I read the books were filled in by the videos in this specialization.

**Introduction to Algorithms** - *pseudocode*<br>
*Authors: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein / ISBN: 978-0-262-03384-8*<br>

## Math

**[Khan Academy Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)**<br>
Everything from addition and subtraction all the way through statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. The first place I'd recommend for anyone wanting to improve their math skills.

**Coursera [Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)**
