I am an experienced C# / SQL developer with a record of successful projects and satisfied application users. Continuous self-improvement, sharing knowledge, and teaching others are among my strengths. I’ve advanced my own career by helping my teammates succeed. I’m a driven self-starter always looking for ways to improve processes and contribute to team success.

    If you are looking for a remote developer and are willing to consider someone who can work full-time September through May and a flexible schedule summers / school breaks, please contact me!  I have a special-needs teen who aged out of available daycare options causing my need for a unique schedule.
