I am a software developer experienced in C# and SQL, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), and various other programming languages. I love to teach and learn from others and prefer to build my carrer by building stronger teams. I have also worked as a systems administrator maintaining AD, Exchange, Hyper-V cluster servers, SAN, and various network equipment, and have worked with PowerShell and VBScript to automate my sysadmin responsibilities.

## Background

Most recently, I have been a C# / T-SQL developer creating and supporting WinForms and ASP\.NET applications and the  SQL databases used by those applications, automating business processes, creating and maintaining SQL Server Reporting Services reports, and automating the creation of reports in Excel using C# and/or VB\.NET.

The majority of my programming experience has been with C#, SQL, and VB\.NET, but I've also developed smaller programs/scripts in Python, VB6, VBScript, C++, JavaScript, PowerShell, and other languages.

Previously, I've worked in end-user support, where I automated many of my routine tasks, leading me to a role administering Systems Management Server *(at the time it was Microsoft SMS but is now called Systems Center Configuration Manager or SCCM)*, where I automated even more routine tasks, then a position administering Active Directory, Exchange, SQL Server, VMWare, and other server and networking products, where I once again automated away the repetitive parts of my job, eventually leading to a full-time developer role.

In addition to my programming and sysadmin work, I also have experience in network administration, installing, configuring, and maintaining Cisco routers, switches, firewalls (ASA), and wireless APs / wireless lan controllers.

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Music Education from the University of Kansas.  My background in education has proved helpful in developing applications that are user-friendly and easy to learn for new users.  I've also put those skills to use in developing end-user training and documentation for my applications.

I learned software development through significant self-study using books, MOOCs, and other online resources.  See my [learning resources](/resources/) page for a partial list of some of the resources I've used that I would recommend to other learners.
