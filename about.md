social-description: Bio / Background info about Shawn Pence
---

I am experienced in C# and SQL development, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), and various other programming languages, with the majority of my programming experience in SQL/SSRS and .NET based application development.  I love to teach and learn from others and prefer to build my carrer by building stronger teams. I have also worked as a systems administrator maintaining AD, Exchange, Hyper-V cluster servers, SAN, and various network equipment, and have worked with PowerShell and VBScript to automate my sysadmin responsibilities.

## Background

Most recently, I have been a C# / T-SQL developer creating and supporting WinForms and ASP\.NET applications, the SQL databases used by those applications, SQL Server Reporting Services reports, and Excel reports generated using C# and/or VB\.NET

Previously, I've worked in end-user support, where I automated many of my routine tasks, leading me to a role administering Systems Management Server (now called Systems Center Configuration Manager), where I automated even more routine tasks, then a position administering AD, Exchange, SQL Server, VMWare, and other server and networking products, where (as you can probably guess), I automated away the boring parts of my job, eventually leading to full-time developer work.

The vast majority of my work has been with C#, SQL, and VB, but I've also developed smaller programs/scripts in Python, VBScript, C++, JavaScript, PowerShell, and other languages.

In addition to my programming and sysadmin work, I also have experience in network administration, working with Cisco routers, switches, firewalls (ASA), and wireless APs / wireless lan controllers.

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Music Education from the University of Kansas.  My background in education has proved helpful in developing applications that are user-friendly and easy to learn for new users.  I've also put those skills to use in developing end-user training and documentation for my applications.

I learned software development through significant self-study using books, MOOCs, and other online resources.  See my [learning resources](/resources/) page for a partial list of some of the resources I've used that I would recommend to other learners.
