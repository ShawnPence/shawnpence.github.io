## Experience / Background

Most recently, I was a C# / T-SQL developer creating and supporting WinForms and ASP\.NET applications and the SQL databases used by those applications, automating business processes, creating and maintaining SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports, and automating the creation of reports in Excel using C# and VB\.NET.

The majority of my programming experience has been with C#, SQL, and VB\.NET, but I've also developed smaller programs/scripts in Python, VB6, VBScript, C++, JavaScript, PowerShell, and other languages.

Previously, I've worked in end-user support, where I automated many of my routine tasks, leading me to a role administering Systems Management Server *(at the time it was Microsoft SMS but is now called Systems Center Configuration Manager or SCCM)*, where I automated even more routine tasks, then a position administering Active Directory, Exchange, SQL Server, VMWare, and other server and networking products, where I once again automated away the repetitive parts of my job, eventually leading to a full-time developer role.

In addition to my programming and sysadmin work, I also have experience in network administration, installing, configuring, and maintaining Cisco and HP switches, Cisco routers, firewalls (ASA), and wireless access points, and wireless LAN controllers.

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Music Education degree.  My background in education has helped me develop applications that are user-friendly and easy to learn, and develop end-user training and documentation for my applications.

I learned software development through significant self-study using books, online courses, and other resources.  See my [learning resources](/resources/) page for a partial list of some of the resources I've used that I would recommend to other learners.
